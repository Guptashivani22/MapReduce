Q1: What is the distribution of prices for each product category ("main_cat")?  Produce 10 evenly split buckets for each category</br>

I have added summarised graph for each category in File Named Graph1.Docx</br>

Q2:How do the products fall with regard to the "date" field?  Bucket by year and month.  Parsing of the date field required.  Note that this field is often bad (separate into a "bad" bucket). </br>

I have added summarised graph for each month for all years in File named Graph2.Docx</br>
